# Bipedal_Walker_Reinforcement_Learning
**TD3 and DDPG implementations for solving the BipedalWalker environment**

This repository contains two advanced deep reinforcement learning algorithms (TD3 and DDPG) trained to solve the **BipedalWalker-v3** environment from OpenAI Gym.

## Features

- **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)** implementation
- **Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)** implementation with clipped double Q-learning

## Performance

| Algorithm | Average Reward | Training Stability | Sample Efficiency |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| TD3       | ~250-300       | High              | Good             |
| DDPG      | ~200-250       | Moderate          | Moderate         |
